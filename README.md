## Errors

Here are the error I encountered:

1. Error: "VirtualizedLists should never be nested inside plain ScrollViews with the same orientation because it can break windowing and other functionality - use another VirtualizedList-backed container instead."

2. Warn: "Possible Unhandled Promise Rejection (id: 1):
Error: The method or property expo-file-system.getInfoAsync is not available on android, are you sure you've linked all the native dependencies properly?"
